# üîç NSE Dashboard Analysis: Current State vs Expected Goals

## ‚ùå **CURRENT PROBLEMS WITH THE DASHBOARD**

### **1. Data Quality Issues**
- **Previous delivery percentages are 0.00%** for many records
- This makes **delivery_increase_pct calculations meaningless**
- Many stocks show inflated increases (e.g., 60,459% increase) because we're dividing by zero
- **Data integrity problem**: Previous baseline dates don't have proper delivery data

### **2. Misleading Business Logic**
- Current dashboard shows "momentum stocks" and "top gainers" based on **flawed calculations**
- **Delivery increase percentages are artificially inflated** due to zero previous values
- Charts and filters are working on **incorrect assumptions**

### **3. Unclear Business Purpose**
- **What are we actually trying to achieve?**
- Are we looking for delivery-based investment opportunities?
- Monthly trend analysis for institutional interest?
- Stock screening for retail investors?

## üéØ **WHAT SHOULD WE ACTUALLY BE SHOWING?**

### **Our Data Structure Analysis:**
```
Table: step03_compare_monthvspreviousmonth
Records: 31,830
Unique Symbols: 2,269
Date Range: Feb 2025 - Aug 2025
Comparison Types: 7 monthly comparisons (FEB vs JAN, MAR vs FEB, etc.)
```

### **Core Business Logic:**
The table compares **current month's delivery data** vs **previous month's delivery data** for each stock to identify:
1. **Delivery percentage changes** month-over-month
2. **Volume and price movements** alongside delivery trends
3. **Institutional interest patterns** (high delivery = institutional buying)

---

## üìä **RECOMMENDED DASHBOARD REDESIGN**

### **Tab 1: Delivery Trend Analysis**
**Purpose**: Track month-over-month delivery percentage changes
```sql
-- Key Metrics:
- Stocks with consistently increasing delivery %
- Delivery percentage > 50% (institutional interest)
- Month-over-month delivery growth
- Volume correlation with delivery increase
```

**What to Show:**
- Line chart of delivery trends by month
- Heatmap of symbols vs months showing delivery %
- Top 20 stocks with consistent delivery growth
- Sector-wise delivery analysis

### **Tab 2: Investment Opportunity Screening**
**Purpose**: Identify stocks with strong institutional backing
```sql
-- Filters:
- Delivery % > 40% (strong institutional interest)
- Price range filters
- Volume increase alongside delivery increase
- Index classification (NIFTY 50, etc.)
```

**What to Show:**
- Screener table with key metrics
- Bubble chart (Price vs Volume vs Delivery %)
- Sector analysis charts
- Risk-return scatter plots

### **Tab 3: Monthly Comparison Deep Dive**
**Purpose**: Month-over-month comparative analysis
```sql
-- Key Analysis:
- Which months had highest delivery increases
- Sector rotation patterns
- New entrants to high-delivery club
- Stocks falling out of institutional favor
```

**What to Show:**
- Monthly comparison bar charts
- Trend analysis over 7 months
- Sector rotation visualization
- Statistical summaries

## üö® **CRITICAL DATA ISSUES TO FIX**

### **Issue 1: Zero Previous Delivery Data**
```
Problem: Previous delivery % = 0.00% for many records
Impact: Delivery increase calculations are meaningless
Solution: Need to verify if previous baseline dates have actual delivery data
```

### **Issue 2: Extreme Outliers**
```
Examples found:
- GSEC10ABSL: +60,459% delivery increase
- AONELIQUID: +50,023% delivery increase
- WENDT: +27,698% delivery increase

These are mathematical artifacts, not real trends
```

### **Issue 3: Business Logic Clarification**
```
Questions to answer:
1. What constitutes a "meaningful" delivery increase?
2. Should we focus on absolute delivery % or percentage change?
3. What's the minimum threshold for institutional interest?
4. How do we handle new listings or stocks with sporadic trading?
```

---

## üí° **PROPOSED SOLUTION APPROACH**

### **Step 1: Data Validation**
1. **Check if previous_baseline_date records exist** in the source data
2. **Identify why previous delivery % is zero** for most records
3. **Implement data quality rules** to filter out invalid comparisons

### **Step 2: Meaningful Metrics**
Instead of percentage increase, focus on:
- **Absolute delivery percentage** (current_deliv_per)
- **Delivery percentage bands** (Low: <30%, Medium: 30-60%, High: >60%)
- **Consistency scores** (how often stock maintains high delivery)
- **Volume-weighted delivery analysis**

### **Step 3: Business-Focused Dashboard**
Create dashboards that answer specific questions:
- **"Which stocks have consistent institutional interest?"** (High delivery % over multiple months)
- **"What are the emerging institutional favorites?"** (Rising delivery trends)
- **"Which sectors are seeing institutional rotation?"** (Sector-wise delivery analysis)

### **Step 4: Realistic Filtering**
- Remove extreme outliers (>1000% increases)
- Focus on stocks with meaningful trading volume
- Implement minimum price filters (>‚Çπ10)
- Add liquidity filters (minimum daily volume)

## üìã **RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **1. Data Investigation**
```sql
-- Check data quality
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN previous_deliv_per = 0 THEN 1 END) as zero_previous,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN delivery_increase_pct > 1000 THEN 1 END) as extreme_outliers
FROM step03_compare_monthvspreviousmonth;
```

### **2. Business Requirements Clarification**
- **Define the target audience**: Retail investors? Institutional analysts? Portfolio managers?
- **Clarify the investment horizon**: Day trading? Swing trading? Long-term investing?
- **Specify the key decisions** the dashboard should support

### **3. Prototype Focused Dashboard**
Create a simple, focused dashboard that shows:
- Top 50 stocks by current delivery percentage
- Month-over-month delivery trends (line charts)
- Sector-wise institutional interest
- Volume vs delivery correlation

---

## üéØ **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

After implementing these changes, the dashboard should:
1. **Provide actionable insights** based on clean, validated data
2. **Support specific investment decisions** with clear metrics
3. **Show meaningful trends** without artificial inflation
4. **Be easily understood** by end users
5. **Focus on institutional delivery patterns** as the core value proposition

## ‚ùì **QUESTIONS FOR YOU**

1. **What is the primary business goal?** 
   - Finding stocks with institutional interest?
   - Monthly trend analysis?
   - Investment screening tool?

2. **Who will use this dashboard?**
   - Retail investors?
   - Portfolio managers?
