---

## 🎯 **EXACT Steps to Find API Key**

### **Step 3.1: Navigate to API Settings**

**What you see:** Your project dashboard with left sidebar

**What to do:**
1. **Look at the LEFT SIDEBAR** of your Supabase project
2. **Scroll down** until you see a section with ⚙️ **"Settings"**
3. **Click on "Settings"** - it might expand to show sub-options

### **Step 3.2: Click on API**

**What you see:** Settings expanded with sub-options

**What to do:**
1. **Under Settings**, look for **📡 "API"**
2. **Click on "API"**
3. **Wait** for the page to load (2-3 seconds)

### **Step 3.3: Find Your Credentials**

**What you see:** API Settings page with various information

**Look for these TWO sections:**

---

#### 🔗 **Section 1: Project URL** 
**Look for:** A box labeled **"Project URL"** or **"URL"**

**It looks like:**
```
Project URL
https://abcdefghijklmnopqr.supabase.co
[📋 Copy button]
```

**Your URL will be:** `https://[random-letters].supabase.co`

**What to do:**
1. **Click the 📋 copy button** next to the URL
2. **Paste it** in notepad or write it down
3. **Example:** `https://xyzabc123def.supabase.co`

---

#### 🔑 **Section 2: API Keys**
**Look for:** A section called **"Project API keys"** or just **"API Keys"**

**You'll see multiple keys, but we need:** **"anon public"** or **"anon/public"**

**It looks like:**
```
anon public
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZ...
[📋 Copy button]  [👁️ Show/Hide button]
```

**What to do:**
1. **Find the key** labeled **"anon"** or **"anon public"** 
2. **Click the 👁️ eye icon** if the key is hidden (shows dots)
3. **Click the 📋 copy button** next to this long key
4. **Paste it** in notepad - it should start with `eyJ`

---

## 📝 **What Your Credentials Should Look Like**

After copying, you should have:

**Project URL:**
```
https://your-random-letters.supabase.co
```

**Anon Key (starts with eyJ):**
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InlvdXItcmFuZG9tLWxldHRlcnMiLCJyb2xlIjoiYW5vbiIsImlhdCI6MTY5NDU2NzgwMCwiZXhwIjoyMDEwMTQzODAwfQ.very-long-signature-here

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "I don't see Settings"**
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're in your **project dashboard**, not the main Supabase page
- Look for your project name at the top
- Settings is usually at the bottom of the left sidebar

### **Issue 2: "I see Settings but no API"**
**Solution:**
- Click on "Settings" to expand it
- Look for sub-items: General, API, Auth, etc.
- API might be called "API Keys" or "Configuration"

### **Issue 3: "The API key is just dots (...)"**
**Solution:**
- Look for a 👁️ eye icon next to the key
- Click it to reveal the full key
- Then copy the revealed key

### **Issue 4: "There are multiple API keys"**
**Solution:**
- We need the **"anon"** or **"public"** key
- **NOT** the "service_role" key (that's for admin access)
- The anon key is safe to use in your scripts

### **Issue 5: "The key doesn't start with eyJ"**
**Solution:**
- Make sure you copied the **full key**
- It should be very long (200+ characters)
- Should start with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI`

---

## ✅ **Verification**

**Your credentials are correct if:**
- ✅ URL starts with `https://` and ends with `.supabase.co`
- ✅ API key starts with `eyJ` and is very long
- ✅ No spaces at beginning or end of either value

---

## 🎯 **Next Step: Create .env File**

Once you have both values, create a file called `.env` in your NSE_Downloader folder:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-url.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.your-actual-long-key-here
```

**Replace with your actual values!**

---

## 🆘 **Still Stuck?**

If you're still having trouble:

1. **Tell me exactly what you see** in the left sidebar
2. **Screenshot or describe** the API page you're looking at  
3. **Let me know** which step above is causing issues
4. **Share any error messages** you're seeing

I'll help you get through this! The API key is definitely there - we just need to find the right place. 🔍
